# ft_linear_regression

The aim of this project is to introduce you to the basic concept behind machine learning.
For this project, you will have to create a program that predicts the price of a car by
using a [linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function) train with a [gradient descent algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent).
We will work on a precise example for the project, but once youâ€™re done you will be
able to use the algorithm with any other dataset.
